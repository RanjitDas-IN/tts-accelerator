## TTS Accelerator

> Real-time natural speech generation — delivers real-time, natural speech from text in as little as 2-3 seconds, handling even extremely long sentences (16,000+ words) with instant voice output—no waiting or file saving.


This library works entirely in RAM to make speech super fast using the Edge-TTS engine. Edge-TTS sounds great, but it slows way down when you ask it to read long sentences—that was a big bottleneck for real-time apps. TTS Accelerator fixes that: it starts talking in just 2–3 seconds, even for thousands of words, by streaming audio straight from memory with no file saves or delays. Whether you’re building a chatbot or powering my AI assistant Nisha, who needs instant replies, this tool makes your app feel quick, smart, and alive.

## What Problem It Solves❓

Most TTS systems force you to wait while they generate the entire audio file — especially for long texts — before playback starts.

That’s slow, frustrating, and unusable for real-time apps.

*TTS Accelerator solves this by streaming audio in real time.*  
It starts playback in just 2–3 seconds, even for huge texts. No disk I/O, no waiting — just seamless, instant voice output.  
Perfect for:
- Voice assistants
- Chatbots
- Narration tools
- Live reading apps

## 💡Insight


TTS Accelerator is designed for ultra-fast playback.
Unlike typical TTS systems that wait for full audio generation, this one begins speaking within 2–3 seconds — even for texts up to 16,000+ words. It streams while generating, offering smooth, natural output with zero delay.


## ✨Key Features

- **Super Fast Speech (Real-Time TTS)**: Begins speaking in just 2–3 seconds, even for extremely long texts — up to 16,000+ words.
- **Highly Compatible**: Seamlessly works with popular TTS engines like Edge-TTS (tested), Coqui TTS etc.. 
- **Streaming Playback**: Audio starts playing instantly while it’s still being generated — no delay, no wait.
- **Minimal API**: Just a single function call to start speaking — `speak_text(text)`.
- **Zero-Delay Playback**: Audio plays with zero delay, It is a smart system that uses fast RAM-based buffering and a separate producer-consumer pipeline to keep things smooth and super quick.


## 🧠Why we Made This Library

While working on our personal AI assistant, Nisha, we (Uday Subba & Ranjit Das) ran into a huge bottleneck:  
Most TTS libraries either sounded robotic or took forever to generate long sentences — especially when trying to keep the voice natural.

We needed something *fast enough for real-time conversation* but still *clear and human-like* — and nothing we found was good enough.  
That’s why we built *TTS Accelerator*.

It streams audio from text in just seconds, even for huge inputs, and it feels natural — exactly what Nisha needed to sound like a confident and responsive AI.

> So yes — this library is not just an experiment, it powers a bigger dream.

## 📚Examples

Simple Usage:

```python
# Import the library
import tts_accelerator as tts

# Example long text to demonstrate real-time speech generation.
text = (
    "Imagine reading out a 1,000-word story or a chatbot message stream — "
    "normally, you'd wait several seconds or even minutes before hearing anything. "
    "But with tts-accelerator, audio playback begins in just 2–3 seconds, "
    "no matter how long the input is. It streams audio directly from RAM, "
    "without saving to disk, and keeps the voice natural and fluid throughout. "
    "This makes it perfect for assistants, narrators, or any real-time voice-based apps."
)

# Speak the text — playback starts almost instantly
tts.speak_text(text)
# it will generate the audio in less than 3 seconds regardless of number of lines in the 'text variable'
```


## 📦Requirements

- Python **_v3.8+_**
- A stable internet connection
